# Advent Of Code puzzle solution



[Advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) is live, I will add older year solutions later.

Create a ***inputs*** folder in Runner project and place your inputs by year/day.txt.


Example: 

```md
 inputs/
 ├── 2024/
 │   ├── day1.txt
```

I used [Spectre Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) to markup puzzle outputs.



**Project Dependencies**

- .NET 9

- C# 13
