# Advent Of Code puzzle solution



[Advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) is live, I will add older year solutions later.

Create a inputs folder and place your inputs by year/day.txt
Example: inputs/2024/day1.txt



I used [Spectre Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) to markup puzzle outputs.
